Additional Questions

-How well does your note-searching-api scale or not scale? How would you make your search more efficient?

This is not a scalable application. To maintain simplicity, the list of notes is stored in a map in memory. As the number of notes increases, this will become an issue. Utilizing a backend database to store the notes would allow the application to scale as well as increase search efficiency.

-How would you add security to your API?
By enabling HTTPS and utilizing some sort of authorization token. The token would need to be present and verified before the API would provide a response.

-What features should we add to this API next?
The aforementioned security would be a good first step. Also the ability to modify and delete notes once they are created. It may also be nice to sort the notes by some (as yet non-present) parameter, perhaps a due-date type of approach.

-How would you test the API?
The simplicity of this API would allow for basic JUnit testing using a mock implementation of the service provided with dummy data.
